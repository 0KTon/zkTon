# zKTon

An NFT aggregator marketplace built on telegram, built during dorahacks hack-a-tonx[https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hack-a-tonx/].

To keep it simple - zKTON- the first NFT marketplace aggregator on the TON blockchain.

Liquidity is the single most important thing for a healthy NFT ecosystem and zKTON is bringing that to the fast growing NFT community on TON.

Some of zKTONâ€™s pioneering innovation includes social buying and portfolio management of NFTs as well as zero-knowledge private metadata and advanced trading analytics.

### Hack a Tonx
In this hackathon, we hope to learn and understand the ton ecosystem, understand func. Finally, create an NFT aggregator which can be used to buy an NFT social via telegram.

We presented this idea in IRL at the Tonx meetup's and there was interest from the TON ecosystem. 
Although TON NFT ecosystem is nascent, as more projects build on it we see this growing.
